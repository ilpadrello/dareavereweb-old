# DAREAVEREWEB

Dareavere is a little software to check balance beetween me and my wife.
It very simple, and you can do it too!
But what tech we should use for this project ?

## INIT THE PROJECT

To initiate the project you can "npm run resetdb"

## Database ? Eh! SQLITE

The idea is to have a DB that you don't have to install, so, the best way to have a db is using [SQLITE](https://www.sqlite.org/);
The database file is inside the database folder.

## FRONT ? Vue3

We are going to use Vue3 for this project, to better understand the framework

## CSS FRAMEWORK ? Vue Bootstrap

We are going to use bootstrap for giving some esthetic to our project

## HOW TO CONNECT

# DARE AVERE WEB (DOCUMENTATION)

## SECURITY

Each Time the application in launched a new JWT Key is generated! You need then to connect in order to use the application.

## SQL PROMISIFY

I have created a Promisifier for the SQLite connector! Use it to make easier connections.
